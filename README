Makefile: Making this file was pretty easy. It was similar to other makefiles; the only new adaptation I made
was figuring out how to put both tcp and tls capability in the same project. In the end, I decided to make
2 c source files, and one makefile that compiled both. No make check was required, so no source files were
needed
