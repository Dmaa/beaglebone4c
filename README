Makefile: Making this file was pretty easy. It was similar to other makefiles; the only new adaptation I made
was figuring out how to put both tcp and tls capability in the same project. In the end, I decided to make
2 c source files, and one makefile that compiled both. No make check was required, so no source files were
needed

lab4c_tcp.c: The adaptations required were fairly simple - I just adapted my old server-client code to open a connection
to the appropriate website, then read from the tcp socket instead of from stdin. I also removed the part of the code
that printed to stdout.

lab4c_tls.c: This program was slightly harder to make. I had to make a new connection, but I also had to use different
functions to read and write, namely ssl_read and ssl_write. Additionally, the TLS server kept crashing while I was
trying to run my program, so that added to the debugging time.
